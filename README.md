## General info

For this project, we didn't have much experience with React.JS and Node.Js and all
of us had to learn the technologies from scratch. This project was basically building a customer-vendor platform for a Food Truck company. It definitely helped us learn a lot of the technologies we had never used before.

Please try our Vendor application on Ipad pro to get a better experience.

## Technologies

Project is created with:

- NodeJs 14.16.0
- React.JS 2.33
- Heroku
- Firebase
- MongoDB
- Express.JS
- Redux
